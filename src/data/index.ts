   Data / service layer — the single seam between the UI and the back end.
   Screens import ONLY from here (`import { getApplications } from '@/data'`).
   No screen touches localStorage or a mock array directly. To wire a real
   back end, replace the bodies of these services with fetch() calls; the
   screens do not change.
