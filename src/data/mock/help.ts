    { id: 'f1', q: 'What is the Guarantee Referral Portal for?', a: 'It lets partner staff refer tenants who cannot pass referencing to opndoor’s professional guarantor service, and track each referral from <b>Sent</b> to <b>Paid</b> to <b>Deed Issued</b>, with live analytics on volume, conversion and fees.' },
    { id: 'f2', q: 'What does opndoor do as guarantor?', a: 'opndoor provides a <b>Deed of Guarantee</b> in favour of the property, for tenants who cannot provide their own guarantor. opndoor is not a party to, or named on, the tenancy agreement. It is a professional guarantor service, not insurance, and the referring agent is the claim contact.' },
    { id: 'f3', q: 'What do Sent, Paid and Deed Issued mean?', a: '<b>Sent</b> means the referral has been sent to the tenant. <b>Paid</b> means the guarantor fee, one month’s rent, has been paid. <b>Deed Issued</b> means the Deed of Guarantee has been issued and stored against the record.' },
    { id: 'f4', q: 'How do I refer a tenant?', a: 'Open <b>New application</b> and complete the sections in order: Tenant, Property, Tenancy, then Agent and branch. You can search for an existing agent and branch or add a new one on the fly. Submit to send the referral.' },
    { id: 'f5', q: 'Are the guarantee reference, issue date and expiry entered by hand?', a: 'No. The guarantee reference, issue date and expiry are <b>assigned automatically</b> once the guarantee is issued. They are not entered on the form; they appear on the application detail view.' },
    { id: 'f6', q: 'Who can use the portal and what can each role see?', a: '<b>opndoor admins</b> are opndoor’s internal team and manage everything, including reconciliation and record mapping. <b>Management</b> sees all tracking and analytics across the whole estate and can add their own users, but cannot edit canonical records or portal settings. <b>Referrers</b> see and track only their own referrals and can add agencies and branches on the fly.' },
    { id: 'f7', q: 'Can I add an agency or branch that is not listed?', a: 'Yes. On the new application form, the agent and branch fields let you search existing records or create a new one on the fly. New records appear on the Agencies and branches screen and are reviewed by opndoor for duplicates.' },
    { id: 'f8', q: 'How are the guarantor fee and commission calculated?', a: 'The guarantor fee is one month’s rent per referral. The partner earns <b>25%</b> of that fee and the agent earns <b>10%</b>. Commission figures are visible to management and opndoor admins only, not to referrers.' },
    { id: 'f9', q: 'Can a tenancy start date be changed after a referral?', a: 'Yes, as long as the new date is within <b>7 days</b> of the payment date. Amending it reissues the Deed of Guarantee with the corrected date. This is available to opndoor admins and management on the application detail view.' },
    { id: 'f10', q: 'How do I find a specific application?', a: 'Use the search and status filters on the <b>Applications</b> screen, or click any figure on the Agencies and branches screen to drill through to the applications behind it.' },
    { id: 'f11', q: 'What time period does the dashboard cover?', a: 'Use the period selector at the top of the dashboard, from the last 7 days through to all time. Every figure and chart updates to match, and the <b>Export CSV</b> button downloads the analytics for the selected period.' },
