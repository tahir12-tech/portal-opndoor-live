/* DEEDS NOT GENERATING, AND WHY NOBODY KNEW.

   Reported as a recurring fault on the live portal. Reading the chain end to end
   (stripe-webhook -> _shared/pandadoc.ts -> pandadoc-webhook) the striking thing
   is not that it can fail. Every integration can. It is that it could fail in
   eight distinct places and every one of them ended in an INTERNAL activity row
   on a single application and nothing else: no ops incident, no queue, nothing
   a person would ever be shown unless they already suspected that one deed and
   went looking for it. "Deeds are not generating" was therefore a thing agents
   told us, days later, one at a time, and the portal's own answer was silence.

   Four of those eight were worse than quiet, they were WRONG:

     - a failed deed_target RPC read as "solo tenancy, already paid", so a joint
       tenancy silently generated a single-tenant deed naming no co-tenants and
       guaranteeing no share;
     - a failed claim_tenancy_deed read as "somebody else has it", so a paid
       application got no deed and no record that one was attempted;
     - a pandadoc_events insert that was not a duplicate read as a duplicate, so
       a signed deed was answered 200 and never redelivered;
     - a deed email the provider refused read as delivered, because nothing in
       the tree ever called record_delivery_attempt and delivery_failed_at is
       what the "Delivery failed" badge reads.

   IT READS THE SOURCE, for the reason payLinkIsDurable.test.ts gives: these are
   Deno edge functions, Deno is not installed here, and they cannot be imported
   into vitest because they reach Deno.env at module scope. What can be checked
   without a runtime is the property that actually matters, which is structural:
   no result that decides whether a deed exists is discarded, and no path that
   ends without a deed ends without telling somebody. */
