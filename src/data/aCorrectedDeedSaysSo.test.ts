/* A CORRECTED DEED SAYS IT IS A CORRECTION.
 *
 * Matt, 2026-10-01, verbatim: "Signed deed email after a tenancy start
 * correction: say so at the top, e.g. 'This corrected deed replaces the
 * one sent on 1 Oct 2026. The tenancy start is now 21 November 2026;
 * please discard the earlier copy.' Same for the tenant's copy."
 *
 * Without it the second email reads as a duplicate of the first, and the
 * one already filed is the one with the wrong date on it.
 *
 * AND THE SAME CORRECTION RE-OPENED A GUARD I CLOSED EARLIER TONIGHT.
 * 20261007320000 made the signed deed go out once, testing "has anything
 * been delivered". After a correction the answer is yes, about a deed
 * that has since been voided, so the corrected one would have been
 * signed and never sent. The test is now which is NEWER, in the webhook
 * and in send_deed_to_agent alike (20261007350000).

  /* THE BUG THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN: a corrected deed signed and never sent.
     Which is the bug it then WAS, on GR-23853, 2026-10-03 -- and this
     assertion is why it is worth rewriting rather than deleting.

     IT PINNED THE IMPLEMENTATION, NOT THE RULE. The rule is "a corrected
     deed has not been delivered". What was asserted here was one way of
     working that out: compare `deed_issued_at` against
     `deed_delivered_at`. That comparison cannot work in the webhook,
     because `deed_issued_at` is written by the very handler that reads
     the row at the top and tests it at the bottom, so the value under
     test is always the row as it stood BEFORE this completion. The test
     passed, the comparison was present, and the deed was still refused.

     So the assertion now names the RULE and the fact that carries it:
     the correction moves the delivery aside (20261007640000) and the
     webhook asks one column. See aCorrectedDeedIsDeliveredToo.test.ts,
     which is the fuller statement of this. */

  });

  /* THE MANUAL SEND KEEPS ITS COMPARISON, and that is deliberate rather
     than an oversight. `send_deed_to_agent` selects the row itself, at
     the moment it tests it, so the stale-read that broke the webhook
     cannot happen there. With the correction now clearing the delivery
     the clause is belt-and-braces: it still answers correctly for any
     reissue path that forgets to clear, which is exactly the mistake
     that caused this. Left alone two days before go-live for that
     reason. */
