// Stripe cannot send a Supabase JWT, so JWT verification is off and security
// is the Stripe signature (STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET). Uses the service role for
// the privileged transition via apply_stripe_payment / apply_stripe_refund.
//
// Idempotency, two layers:
//  1. Each event id is inserted into stripe_events; a duplicate delivery is a
//     no-op (returns 200 without processing).
//  2. apply_stripe_payment only transitions a still-Sent application, so a
//     repeated completed event never double-transitions.
//
// Failure / abandonment (payment_intent.payment_failed, checkout.session.expired)
// leave status untouched. Refunds are recorded without reversing Sent -> Paid.
//
// LIVE AND SANDBOX ARRIVE AT THE SAME URL. Stripe sends test-mode and live-mode
// events to the same endpoint, and the mode is derived from WHICH SIGNING SECRET
// VERIFIES THE SIGNATURE, never from anything in the body. livemode is a field in
// a Stripe event, but reading it would mean trusting a value from a request whose
// authenticity is the very thing being established, so it is deliberately
// ignored. A caller who cannot forge the sandbox HMAC cannot make a live event
// look like a sandbox one.
//
// The verified mode is then cross-checked against the application's own livemode.
// They can only disagree if an event from one mode is replayed against an
// application from the other, so a mismatch is refused outright and raises an ops
// alert rather than being reconciled.

           and claim_tenancy_deed while this one was left.

           apply_stripe_refund is the only writer of payment_state = 'refunded'. If
           it fails, everything below still runs on a refund that never applied: the
           tenant is emailed a refund confirmation, the outstanding deed is voided,
           and the activity trail says "Payment refunded in Stripe", while the row
           still says the fee is paid. We answer 200, so Stripe never redelivers, and
           the stripe_events dedup row makes a manual redelivery a no-op.

           The consequence is not a stale flag. ApplicationDetail gates the deed
           controls on `paymentState !== 'refunded'`, which now passes, so Generate
           renders on a refunded application and mints a fresh Deed of Guarantee.
           apply_deed_executed's own refund guard reads payment_state too, finds it
           clean, and executes and delivers that deed to the agent as valid. A
           refunded tenant ends up guaranteed. That is DEFECTS.md 9 reopened through
           the front door.

           for ever, and the application would never be marked at all --
           still fully paid, commission still paid, deed still live. So this
           is matched by code, reported LOUDLY with the guarantee and the
           amount, and answered 200 so Stripe stops.

             LAST, DELIBERATELY. Every step above concerns the tenant whose
             refund this event is about, and each of them must have happened
             before we start moving other people's money -- if the cascade
             throws, the tenant who was actually refunded has still had their
             guarantee cancelled and still been told.

             THE CASCADE DOES NOT CANCEL DEEDS OR SEND TENANT EMAILS. Each
             refund it takes raises its own charge.refunded event, which
             arrives here and runs everything above for that co-tenant. One
             code path for "a tenant was refunded", whether a person did it
             in Stripe or we did it automatically.

             NEVER FAILS THE WEBHOOK. A 5xx here would have Stripe redeliver
             an event whose refund HAS been applied, and the resend buys
             nothing the ledger does not already give us: the open rows are
             swept by the next refund event, and any failure is on Home and

               tenant's refund, and never again on webhook redeliveries."

               MY BUG, AND THE CAUSE WAS THE THING I WAS PLEASED ABOUT. Each

               here is per TENANT and belongs on that path. This is per
               PROPERTY and did not.

               THE CLAIM ANSWERS BOTH HALVES. `claim_cancellation_notice`
               returns true only when no paid tenant on the tenancy is still
               unrefunded (it is time) AND no row has been written for it
               before (it has not been done). The insert is the claim, so
               two co-tenants' webhooks landing together cannot both win,
