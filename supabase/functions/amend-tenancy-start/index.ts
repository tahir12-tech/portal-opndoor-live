       name."

       IT IS A PRIVACY RULE AS MUCH AS A COPY ONE. An agency has no
       business knowing which of us touched their record, and naming one
       invites them to ask for that person next time.

       ONE PLACE, because `actor` reaches five sentences from here: two
       activity messages, the activity rows' own actor column, the
       "corrected deed sent" line through deliverSigningInvite, and the
       referrer's "the tenancy start date has changed ... by X" email.
       Rewriting those five would be five chances to miss one.

       AND NOT FOR A CUSTOMER'S OWN PEOPLE. An agency Manager amending
       their own referral is still named: that is a colleague, and the
       agency has every reason to know which of them moved a date. The
       rule is about us, so the test is is_opndoor_staff() -- asked of

       Matt, 2026-10-04: the activity log said "amended from 17/10/2026 to
       17/10/2026". It was not a read-after-write: `oldDmy` is taken above,
       before the RPC. It was this function running TWICE, and the log on dev
       proves it. Two tenancy_amended rows six seconds apart:

         17:00:21  tenancy_amended  from 17/10/2026 to 17/10/2026
         17:00:21  deed_voided      ... amendment from 16/10/2026 ...
         17:00:27  tenancy_amended  from 16/10/2026 to 17/10/2026

       One call read 16 and moved it, taking six seconds over voiding and
       regenerating the deed. A second call, arriving while the first was
       still working, read the date the first had ALREADY WRITTEN, found
       nothing to do, and logged that it had done it. The correct row is the
       17:00:27 one; the meaningless one was written first and is the one a
       reader sees at the top.

       SO THE GUARD IS THE RULE ITSELF rather than a lock: amending a date to
       the date it already has is a no-op, and a no-op writes no audit row,
       voids no deed and sends no email. That is true whatever caused the
