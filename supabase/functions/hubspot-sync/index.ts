// hubspot-sync  (verify_jwt = false)
//
// Portal -> HubSpot, one-way, event-driven. Consumes public.activity_log since
// a cursor, translates each lifecycle event through the CONFIG mapping tables
// (hubspot_sync_env / hubspot_field_map / hubspot_partner_map), and upserts
// Applicants + Companies + associations via the HubSpot v3/v4 CRM APIs. See
// HUBSPOT-SYNC-SPEC.md. Nothing here hard-codes a HubSpot object/pipeline/stage/
// association id — the active (sandbox) / dormant (production) blocks live in
// hubspot_sync_env; promotion is a config swap.
//
// Guardrails baked in:
//   §5 never-touch  — sync writes ONLY its own columns; a defensive filter drops
//                     calculation/owner/attribution/finance fields if they ever
//                     appear in a payload.
//   §8 no Contacts  — the ONLY object types this function ever writes are the
//                     Applicant custom object and companies. There is no code
//                     path to the contacts object; tenants never become Contacts.
//   §9 no backfill  — the cursor is initialised at go-live; pre-existing debris
//                     is never in range.
//   Idempotency     — every action keys on (event id, target) in
//                     hubspot_sync_events; and every HubSpot write is idempotent
//                     by construction (upsert on a unique property; PUT assoc).
//   Failures        — reported through the existing ops-alert channel via
//                     report_ops_incident('hubspot_sync_error:<partner>', …).
//                     The suffix is not decoration: ops_alerts dedupes on
//                     (alert_type, coalesce(application_id,zero), hour_bucket)
//                     and this function always passes a null application_id, so
//                     a bare type let the FIRST partner to fail in an hour hide
//                     every other partner's failure for the rest of it. Same
//                     convention as 'cron_error:<jobname>'.
//                     The cursor holds at the last success so the batch retries;
//                     and because a retry that can never succeed is a queue that
//                     never drains, a repeatedly failing event is PARKED after
//                     MAX_ATTEMPTS and PARK_AFTER_MS (see the catch) and the
//                     partner's queue moves past it.
//   Config gaps     — a missing hubspot_partner_map row, a partner company that
//                     does not exist in the Hub, an unset association type id:
//                     these are config, not data, and they used to THROW, which
//                     froze that partner's whole feed permanently. They now gate
//                     the affected edge exactly as the §6 org gate does (warn,
//                     alert, leave the ledger unrecorded so a later event
//                     completes it) and the queue keeps draining.
//
// Auth (manual/cron trigger): x-ops-secret matched against REMINDERS_CRON_SECRET
// (edge env) OR the ops_secrets 'reminders_cron' mirror — the same shape as
// ops-alert / the reminder crons. The sandbox smoke invokes it exactly like a
// cron would: via pg_net, with the secret read from ops_secrets inside SQL.

    //   2. the referring agent's BRANCH company — for a multi-branch group the
    //      applicant links to the specific branch child (NOT the group parent);
    //      for a single-office agency the single company plays the branch role.
    // Agency/group-level rollups traverse the branch->parent company link (§6), so
    // there is no direct applicant->parent edge. Exactly two edges, which also sits
    // within the sandbox's 2-companies-per-record association cap.
    //
    // Per-APPLICATION role ledger: the branch is minted/attached only once its org
    // is confirmed (§6 gate). If a referral lands before confirmation, the partner
    // edge is made now and the branch edge is completed on a LATER event once the
    // org is confirmed (§1) — the state is keyed on the application, not the event.
    //
    // WHY THE TWO CONFIG CHECKS BELOW GATE RATHER THAN THROW. Both used to be
    // `throw`, and both are config states that persist until a human changes
    // config: a partner with no hubspot_partner_map row, and a partner company
    // that does not exist in the Hub. A throw here stops the partner at this
    // event and the cron retries the same event every two minutes, so a config
    // gap did not delay that partner's sync, it ENDED it, and the only trace
    // was one ops-alert in the first hour. Nothing downstream reads
    // stuck_since, so nobody found out from the system.
    //
    // A missing hubspot_partner_map row is not a rare state. The seed migration
    // (20260705150500) filled the table from `partners` AS IT WAS THAT DAY, and
    // nothing has filled it since: the trigger added with the per-partner
    // cursors seeds hubspot_sync_cursor_partner on insert and has no companion
    // for the map. Every partner created after the seed ran therefore has a
    // cursor, has events, and has no map row. On dev that is all seven of them.
    //
    // Gating matches what §6 already does for an unconfirmed org: the edge is
    // skipped, nothing is recorded, and the ledger's per-APPLICATION key means a
    // later event for the same application completes it once config lands. The
    // applicant properties still reach HubSpot in the meantime, which is the
