// AND IT CARRIES THE AGENCY LEVEL. Director, Manager and Negotiator are two roles
// and one boolean: Negotiator is 'referrer', Director and Manager are both
// 'management' and differ only by users.sees_commission. That boolean is written
// here, from the dialog's choice, and may only be granted by a caller who holds it
// themselves. It used to be ignored, so every management invite landed as a
