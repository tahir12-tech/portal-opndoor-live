// payment-confirmation (verify_jwt = false)
//
// Public, unauthenticated endpoint for the tenant's post-payment page. It is
// keyed to the Stripe Checkout **session id**, which is high-entropy and only
// ever handed to the tenant (via Stripe's success/cancel redirect). Given that
// capability it returns the MINIMAL confirmation state and nothing more:
//   - first name, guarantee reference, amount, whether the fee is paid,
//   - whether the Deed of Guarantee is ready to sign yet.
// It never returns the tenant's email, surname, address, phone or any other row
// data. On the explicit { action: "sign" } it mints a PandaDoc signing-session
// link (recipient-scoped by PandaDoc) and returns it, so the deep-link is only
// created on a real click, not on every poll.
//
// Abuse protection: the session id is unguessable (so enumeration is infeasible)
// AND every call is rate-limited via bump_rate_limit on two tiers - a coarse
// best-effort per-IP meter (all requests, incl. malformed) plus an authoritative
// per-session meter, with signing-link mints capped hardest. Unknown or malformed
// ids get a neutral { found: false } (no existence oracle).
