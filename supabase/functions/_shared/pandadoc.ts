// whatever address a developer POSTs as tenant_email genuinely receives an
// email, which is why the Dev Centre surfaces the signing link with a warning.
//
// The tenant is the only live signer. The opndoor signature is a facsimile
// image placed as static content in the template. The Issue Date is the deed's
// dated line and must NOT be recipient-editable, so it is a merge token
// (issue_date = the generation date, Europe/London) rather than a PandaDoc date
// field. Six tokens are merged from the application record; the template has one

         create and send deeds silently so PandaDoc sends no email of its
         own."

         A tenant was getting two emails about one deed from two senders
         within a minute of each other, and the one with the button was
         PandaDoc's, in PandaDoc's voice. Opndoor now sends it, through
         `deliverSigningInvite`, from all three paths: the payment receipt,
         Resend signature request, and the corrected deed after a start-date
         change.

         THE DOCUMENT IS STILL SENT, which is the half not to get wrong.
         `silent` suppresses PandaDoc's notification email; it does not
         suppress the send, so the document still leaves draft and is still
         signable. If this were read as "do not send", the deed would sit in
         draft and nothing downstream would work at all -- which is loud,
         and is the failure mode to prefer over a silent one.

         THE SUBJECT AND MESSAGE ARE KEPT rather than removed. They are
         still what a recipient sees inside the PandaDoc signing page, and
         they are what a reminder sent from PandaDoc's own UI would carry if
         anybody ever used it. */

         two senders within a minute, and the one with the button was
         PandaDoc's, in PandaDoc's voice. Opndoor now sends it, from every
         path that issues a deed (see everyDeedTellsItsTenant.test.ts).

         SANDBOX: not silent, because making it silent would leave a
         developer with NO signing email from anybody. `maySendOpndoorEmail`
         is `livemode` and says so in terms -- "Sandbox sends none. Not a
         different from address, not a redirect to a review mailbox: none"
         -- and its own comment already records that PandaDoc's signing
         email is the deliberate exception, "because rehearsing the tenant's
         signing journey is most of the point". Silent everywhere would have
         quietly deleted that rehearsal, which nobody asked for and which
         the Dev Centre would then be documenting falsely.

         FOR MATT: if sandbox should fall silent too, it is this line plus
         an exemption in maySendOpndoorEmail, and the Dev Centre warning
         changes again. My recommendation is to leave it: sandbox has no

     Generate arriving after the first has stamped its id is refused. It cannot
     close the CONCURRENT one, because both presses read "no document" before
     either has created one, and creating one at PandaDoc takes seconds. That is
     exactly the window a person double-clicking a button occupies, and the result
     is two live signable Deeds of Guarantee for one application, the second
     stamped over the first, the first left live in PandaDoc with nothing in the
     portal pointing at it.

     THE LEASE SITS HERE, around the whole run, rather than at the call sites.
     There are seven of them (stripe-webhook, pandadoc-resend,
     pandadoc-void-regenerate, tenancy-correction x2, amend-tenancy-start x2) and
     a guard that each has to remember to take is a guard that the eighth will not
     have. Wrapping the shared function covers all seven and any that follow.

     FAIL CLOSED. If the lease cannot be taken we do not generate. A paid tenant
     whose deed is delayed parks as needs-attention after three attempts and a
     person fixes it in minutes; two live signable guarantees, one of which
     nothing is tracking, is not recoverable at all. This does mean the migration

     It did not happen on GR-20846 during the walk, but not because of a guard: the

     never reached here. The card was showing a stale error snapshot, which is the
