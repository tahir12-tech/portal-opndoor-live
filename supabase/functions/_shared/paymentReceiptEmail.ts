// branch runs once per event, and the send is gated on the fresh Paid transition.

/* AND THEIR DOOR TO THE DEED. Matt (ai): PandaDoc now sends nothing, so this

   THE PAY PAGE TOKEN, not a PandaDoc session URL: it lives for 90 days in an
   inbox and PayLanding mints a fresh signing session on arrival, where a
   session link embedded here would be minted at send time and dead long
   before anybody clicked it.

   A FAILURE HERE DOES NOT STOP THE RECEIPT. Their money has moved and the

   without a button, and the signing invite can be re-sent from the
