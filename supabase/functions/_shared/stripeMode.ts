// Stripe key mode guard, shared by payment-page, stripe-webhook and
// create-referral.
//
// The problem this solves: those three functions previously hardcoded
// `startsWith("sk_live_")`, so a test key was rejected everywhere. That made the
// payment path impossible to exercise on any non-production project, and the
// only way to make a dev project work was to install live Stripe credentials on
// it, which risks real cards being charged from a disposable environment.
//
// The rule here is symmetric: the key mode must MATCH the project it is running
// on. A non-production project requires sk_test_, and everything else requires
// sk_live_. That blocks both accidents, not just the one.
//
// Why the project ref and not an env var: SUPABASE_URL is injected by the
// platform, and Supabase reserves the SUPABASE_ prefix so it cannot be set or
// overridden with `supabase secrets set`. An operator therefore cannot relax
// production from the dashboard. A plain ALLOW_TEST_STRIPE flag would put
// production's safety behind a value anyone with dashboard access could change.
//
// Fail closed: an unrecognised ref (including a missing or malformed
// SUPABASE_URL) falls through to requiring sk_live_. A new environment must be
// added to NON_PRODUCTION_REFS in a reviewed change before it can use test keys,
// rather than defaulting to permissive.
//
// Production needs no configuration change for this: its behaviour is identical
// to the previous hardcoded guard.
