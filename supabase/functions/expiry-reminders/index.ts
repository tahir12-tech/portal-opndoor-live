       This was the referrer PLUS `users where role='management'` for the whole
       partner, with no status, position or agency filter. On the agency rail
       every agency shares the house partner, so a reminder naming one agency's
       tenant, property and branch went to every other agency's managers.

       An expiry reminder is a per-application notification, so it takes the
       same rule as everything else on that rail: the referrer, plus whoever is
       ticked within their position. That rule, and the supplier and direct
       equivalents, are now all behind notification_recipients, which is asked
       once per reminder below.

       The whole-estate management list that used to be built here is gone
       with it: it selected every active management user on every partner and
       was only ever consumed by the non-agency arm. A query that gathers
       every partner's staff addresses to pick two of them is worth deleting

            /* WHICH RAIL, NOT WHICH LIST LENGTH.

               This chose the partner-wide list whenever the agency ladder came
               back empty. Empty is not "this is not an agency referral" -- it
               is a deactivated referrer with nobody ticked and no manager
               covering the branch, which is precisely the case the ladder
               exists to handle. So the one application whose recipients could
               not be resolved was the one that went to every agency on the
               house route, naming another agency's tenant and property.

               The same expression swallowed the RPC's error: a failed call
               also returns nothing, so an outage read as "not an agency
               referral" and broadcast. The channel is asked first, and it is
               asked of the application. */
            /* application_channel, NOT application_is_agent_estate. The
               estate flag is TRUE for 'opndoor-direct', which is seeded
               opndoor_referenced, so every direct guarantee asked the agency
               ladder, got nothing (the ladder is gated on 'Agent referral'),
               and parked with an ops incident. A permanent false alarm on a
               rail that has no agency ladder to consult. 20261006160000
               named this exact trap for deed_delivery_target and switched to
               application_channel; this call site was not converted. */
            /* ONE DOOR, FOR EVERY RAIL. Q-02 and Q-03.
               This asked the agency ladder on one rail and built a list of
               that PARTNER's management on the others, which is both wider
               than the rule in one direction (every manager on the partner)
               and narrower in another (never the branch desk the referral
               actually came from) -- gap 3 in docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md.

               notification_recipients answers for all three rails and applies
               the party's matrix, so the rail test, the ladder call and the
               partner-management list all collapse into it. The PARKING below
               is untouched and matters more than ever: an expiry that reaches
               nobody must be said out loud, and now "nobody" can also mean
               "somebody turned this off", which is a thing worth an ops line
