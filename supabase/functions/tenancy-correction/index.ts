// Public token exchange for #81. An agent opens the tokenised link from the
// executed-deed email, sees the guarantee reference and the current tenancy
// start, and enters the correct date. Submitting APPLIES the correction
// automatically: the corrected date is written, the outstanding or executed deed
// is voided (a signed PDF is archived first), a corrected deed is regenerated and
// sent to the tenant to sign again, and once they sign the agent receives the new
// executed deed automatically (the completion webhook re-fires for the new
// document id). It is logged as an agent correction. There is no opndoor review.
//
// The deed lifecycle mirrors amend-tenancy-start's (the staff path), keyed on the
// deed state, and reuses the same shared primitives (voidDocument / generateDeed).
// It runs with the SERVICE ROLE because the agent has no login: amend_tenancy_start
// is gated on AAL2 + ownership and cannot be reached from here.
//
// The token is a random uuid scoped to one deed, expiring 7 days after delivery.

         R5 (20261006860000) made the STAFF path do this and said why: one
         corrected application of a joint let leaves "two executed
         instruments stating different start dates for the same let", and
         `expiry_date` is GENERATED from `tenancy_start`, so the
         discrepancy reaches the underwriter on the bordereau. This path
         never went through that RPC -- it cannot, the RPC needs AAL2 and a
         caller and the agent has neither -- so it moved one row by id.

         `tenancy_id` is nullable and most applications have none. A solo
         application is a set of one, which keeps every step below
         identical for both cases rather than forking them. */

         The "load" action reported alreadySubmitted and the screen hid the

         the tenancy start again and, for an executed guarantee, archived the
         signed PDF and reissued the deed for signing. A forwarded email or a
         double-click on a slow connection was enough.

         Claiming first also closes the race that ordering alone would not: the
